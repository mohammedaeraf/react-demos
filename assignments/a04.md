## 📝 **Assignment 04**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

To practice using **React state (`useState`)**, conditional rendering, and **event handling** in a functional component.

---

### 📄 **Title:**

**"Build a Toggle Switch Component with Image and Status Display"**

---

### 💡 **Description:**

Create a React component named `ToggleSwitch.tsx` that simulates an ON/OFF switch using images. Clicking the image should toggle between the ON and OFF state.

The component should:

1. Use the `useState` hook to manage the toggle state (`isOn`).
2. Display the **current status** (`ON` or `OFF`) as a heading.
3. Display an image that corresponds to the current status:

   * `on.jpg` if ON
   * `off.jpg` if OFF
4. Switch between ON and OFF images when the image is clicked.

---

### 🖼️ **Assets:**

Use two images (store them inside the `src/assets/` directory):

* `on.jpg` (for ON state)
* `off.jpg` (for OFF state)

---

### 🔧 **Functional Requirements:**

* Clicking on the image toggles the state (`true` ⇄ `false`)
* Status heading updates based on the state
* Image updates based on the state

---

### 🧪 **Example Output:**

```plaintext
Status: OFF

[Image showing OFF switch]

-- after clicking --

Status: ON

[Image showing ON switch]
```
