#### 📝 **Objective**

Create a reusable **`UserProfile`** React component that takes multiple props and displays user details such as name, age, and a list of qualifications.

#### 📋 **Instructions**

   * `name`: a string representing the user’s name.
   * `age`: a number representing the user’s age.
   * `qualifications`: an array of strings representing the user's educational qualifications.
3. Display the `name` and `age` as a heading.
4. Display the list of `qualifications` as an unordered list.
5. Use this component in the `App.tsx` file to render **at least two user profiles** with different data.


#### ✅ **Expected Output**

A page showing at least two user profiles, each displaying:

* The user’s name and age.
* A bullet list of their qualifications.
