## üìù Assignment 12: RecipeList with Search Functionality

### Objective

Build a React component to display a list of recipes based on a search term entered by the user. Fetch data from the DummyJSON API using the `q` query parameter:  
[https://dummyjson.com/recipes?q=Pizza](https://dummyjson.com/recipes?q=Pizza)

---

### Requirements

1. **Search Box**
   - Add a text input where the user can enter a search term (e.g., "Pizza", "Soup", "Cake").
   - Add a button labeled "Search" to trigger the search.

2. **Fetch Recipes by Search**
   - When the user submits a search, fetch recipes from the API using the `q` query parameter (e.g., `https://dummyjson.com/recipes?q=Pizza`).
   - Show a loading indicator while fetching data.
   - Handle and display errors if the fetch fails.

3. **Display Recipes**
   - Show each recipe in a Bootstrap Card.
   - Each card should display:
     - Recipe image
     - Name
     - Cuisine
     - Difficulty

---

### Bonus

- Show a message if no recipes are found for the search term.
