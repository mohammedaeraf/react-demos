## üìù Assignment 13B: Extend Courses App ‚Äì Implement Delete Course Functionality

### Objective

Extend your Courses App to allow users to delete a course from the list. When a user deletes a course, it should be removed from both the UI and the MockAPI backend.

---

### Requirements

1. **Delete Button**
   - Add a "Delete" button to each row in the courses table.

2. **Delete Functionality**
   - When the "Delete" button is clicked, send a DELETE request to the corresponding MockAPI endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-project>.mockapi.io/courses/:id`).
   - After successful deletion, update the UI to remove the deleted course from the table.

3. **User Feedback**
   - Optionally, show a confirmation dialog before deleting.
   - Optionally, show a success or error message after deletion.

4. **General**
   - Use Bootstrap classes for styling the button.
   - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., show an alert if the delete fails).

**Deliverable:**  
A React component that fetches, displays, and allows deletion of courses from MockAPI in a Bootstrap-styled table.
