## üìù Assignment 13C: Extend Courses App ‚Äì Implement Add and Edit Course Functionality

### Objective

Further extend your Courses App to allow users to **add new courses** and **edit existing courses**. These actions should update both the UI and the MockAPI backend.

### Requirements

1. **Add Course**
   - Add a button or link labeled "Add Course" above the courses table.
   - Clicking "Add Course" should navigate to a form where the user can enter the course title and description.
   - On form submission, send a POST request to your MockAPI endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-project>.mockapi.io/courses`) to create the new course.
   - After successful addition, navigate back to the course list and show the updated table.

2. **Edit Course**
   - Add an "Edit" button to each row in the courses table.
   - Clicking "Edit" should navigate to a form pre-filled with the selected course's data.
   - On form submission, send a PUT or PATCH request to your MockAPI endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-project>.mockapi.io/courses/:id`) to update the course.
   - After successful update, navigate back to the course list and show the updated table.
