## üìù Assignment 14: Todo List Manager Using useReducer

### Objective

Build a React component called **TodoListReducer** using the `useReducer` hook. The component should allow users to add, toggle, and remove todo items, demonstrating state management with useReducer.

---

### Requirements

1. **Component State**
   - Use `useReducer` to manage the todo list state.
   - The state should be an array of todo objects, each with:
     - `id` (number)
     - `text` (string)
     - `completed` (boolean)

2. **Actions**
   - Support the following actions:
     - `"add"`: Add a new todo with the given text.
     - `"toggle"`: Toggle the completed status of a todo.
     - `"remove"`: Remove a todo by id.

3. **UI**
   - Display a text input and an "Add" button to add new todos.
   - Show the list of todos. Each todo should display its text and a button to toggle completion.
   - Completed todos should be styled differently (e.g., with a line-through).
   - Each todo should have a "Remove" button.
