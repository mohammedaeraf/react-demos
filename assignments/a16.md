## ðŸ›’ Assignment 16 (Project Work): CartApp MVP with React Context

### Objective

Build a minimal viable product (MVP) shopping cart application (**CartApp**) using React and the Context API. The app should allow users to add items to a cart, view the cart, and clear the cart. Focus on implementing the core features using best practices.

---

### Requirements

1. **Cart Context**
   - Create a `CartContext` using React's Context API.
   - The context should provide:
     - The current cart (an array of cart items).
     - An `addToCart(item)` function to add an item or increase its quantity.
     - A `clearCart()` function to empty the cart.

2. **Cart Provider**
   - Implement a `CartProvider` component that manages the cart state and provides the context to its children.

3. **useCart Hook**
   - Create a custom `useCart` hook to access the cart context in any component.

4. **Add to Cart**
   - Provide a way for users to add items (with `id`, `name`, and `price`) to the cart.
   - If an item is already in the cart, increase its quantity.

5. **View Cart**
   - Display the list of items in the cart, showing their name, price, and quantity.

6. **Clear Cart**
   - Provide a button to clear all items from the cart.

7. **Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript for all components and context.

8. **Styling**
   - Use Bootstrap or simple CSS for basic styling.
